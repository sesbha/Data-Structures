Then we can initialize an empty list to represent the list of scrambled letters (scramble_lst). Iterating through the numbers in perm_lst, we can take each number to be the index value and obtain the corresponding letter of the word, which we can append to scramble_lst. Then we can return a scrambled word in string format by using the join method. Note that instead of using scramble_lst, we could have initialized an empty string and added each letter of the word using +=, however string concatentation produces a new string each time it is performed, which would not be optimal in terms of time complexity.
