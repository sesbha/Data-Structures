In\tother words, each number is\tthe\tsum\tof the previous\ttwo\tnumbers. The first 10 numbers in Fibonacci sequence\tare: 1,\t1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55.

    "A generator in Python, is an iterator that allows to break the execution of the code. Generators perform lazy evaluation by producing an iterable sequence and exposing elements only when they are needed. In this way, generators avoid storing all the elements at once in the memory. When a \"yield\" is reached in the code, the execution of the code is put on pause, and a snapshot of the active data frame as well as the position of where execution should resume in the code is stored. Then, when the next(iterator) is called, the execution resumes.     "
